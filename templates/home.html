            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #555;">Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread
                musculoskeletal pain, accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood issues. Researchers believe that
                fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain and spinal cord process
                painful and nonpainful signals.</p>

            <h2 style="color: var(--secondary-color, #34495e); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Symptoms</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #555;">The primary symptoms of fibromyalgia include:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #555;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Widespread pain:</strong> The pain associated with
                    fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months.
                    To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your
                    waist.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Fatigue:</strong> People with fibromyalgia often awaken
                    tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain,
                    and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and
                    sleep apnea.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Cognitive difficulties:</strong> A symptom commonly referred
                    to as "fibro fog" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section style="margin-bottom: 2.5rem;">
            <h2 style="color: var(--secondary-color, #34495e); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Causes</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #555;">Doctors don't know what causes fibromyalgia, but it most likely
                involves a variety of factors working together. These may include:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; color: #555;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Genetics:</strong> Because fibromyalgia tends to run in
                    families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing
                    the disorder.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Infections:</strong> Some illnesses appear to trigger or
                    aggravate fibromyalgia.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"><strong>Physical or emotional events:</strong> Fibromyalgia can
                    sometimes be triggered by a physical trauma, such as a car accident. Prolonged psychological stress
                    may also trigger the condition.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="color: var(--secondary-color, #34495e); margin-bottom: 1rem;">Treatment</h2>
            <p style="color: #555;">While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control
                symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help.</p>
